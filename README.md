## Tamagotchi Game

This mini-project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple game that simulates the iconic Tamagotchi.

In this game, the user is able to create their own Tamagotchi pet and give it a custom name. Following the on-screen buttons, the user must interact with the Tamagotchi to prevent their metrics from reaching 10.

The Tamagotchi pet is also able to evolve into higher forms. You'll be able to see your pet undergo these evolutions if you manage to keep it alive for long enough. 

Good luck!
